## User Settings Page - Flutter:

## About :
I designed a user settings page that is clean and user-friendly.

### Header:
***
 At the top, I included a clear heading labeled "User settings," making the purpose of the page obvious.

#### User Information Section:
***
I created a blue card that prominently displays the user's profile information, including my name ("Ali Altarouty") and my job ("Flutter Developer").
Below the name, I added four key metrics: "Collect," "Attention," "Track," and "Coupons," providing quick access to important user activities.
Quick Access Icons:

Below the user information, I placed four circular icons labeled "Wallet," "Delivery," "Message," and "Service" to enable quick navigation to commonly used features.

#### Settings Options:
***
I organized the page with a series of list items, each containing an icon, title, and brief description:
* Address: "Ensure your harvesting address" (for location or delivery settings).
* Privacy: "System Permission change" (for privacy-related settings).
* General: "Basic functional settings" (for general settings).
* Notifications: "Take over the news on time" (for notification settings).
* Support: "We are here to help" (for accessing help or support).

#### Visual Design:
***
I opted for a modern and minimalistic design, using soft colors and rounded elements to create a friendly user experience.
The icons are simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate.
