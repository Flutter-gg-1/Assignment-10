## My first simple UI project using flutter
In this assignment i learnd the basics for flutter so i tryied to apply the widget to complete 
a simple **settings page** üòé

### the widgit that been used is:
- Scaffold:
  Provides a basic structure for the visual interface, including app bars, drawers, and a body. It‚Äôs often the main layout widget in a Flutter app.

- SafeArea:
  Ensures that the UI is not overlapped by system UI elements like the status bar or the notch, by adding padding as needed.

- Center:
  Aligns its child widget in the center of the available space.

- Column:
  Arranges its child widgets in a vertical direction (from top to bottom).

- Text:
  Displays a string of text with configurable styling such as font size, color, and weight.

- Container:
  A versatile widget that can contain other widgets, apply padding, margins, and other styling like background color, borders, and rounded corners.

- BoxDecoration:
  Used within a Container to apply styling such as background color, border radius, and shadows.

- Row:
  Arranges its child widgets in a horizontal direction (from left to right).

- Padding:
  Adds space around its child widget, controlling the distance from the widget‚Äôs boundary to its surrounding content.

- Icon:
  Displays a graphical symbol or glyph, typically from the Material Icons set, which can represent actions, objects, or symbols.

- SizedBox:
  A box with a fixed size that can be used to add space between widgets or control the size of its child widget.
